                    <ul>
                        <li>COVID-19 is the disease caused by the new coronavirus that was first identified in December 2019. </li>
                        <li>COVID-19 symptoms include cough, fever or chills, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, muscle or body aches, sore throat, new loss of taste or smell, diarrhea, headache, new fatigue, nausea or vomiting and congestion or
                            runny nose. COVID-19 can be severe, and some cases have caused death.</li>
                        <li>The new coronavirus can be spread from person to person. It is diagnosed with a laboratory test.</li>
                        <li>There is no coronavirus vaccine yet. Prevention involves frequent hand-washing, coughing into the bend of your elbow, staying home when you are sick and wearing a cloth face covering if you can't practice physical distancing.</li>
                        <li>This plugin adds a Coronavirus notice message to either the top, bottom, or inside the text on a website. This free plugin allows website owners to quickly and easily add a notification banner about COVID-19. Key features include,
                            options for where to display notification (top, top static, bottom, bottom static, or inside your text using a shortcode). Additionally, the plugin offers a optional “read more” link to direct viewers to a web page with more
                            information.

                    <h1>How does the new coronavirus spread?</h1>
                    <p>As of now, researchers know that the new coronavirus is spread through droplets released into the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes. The droplets generally do not travel more than a few feet, and they fall to the ground
                        (or onto surfaces) in a few seconds — this is why physical distancing is effective in preventing the spread.</p>

                <li> antibody test might tell you if you had a past infection.</li>

                </li>
                <li>People who have taken part in activities that put them at higher risk for COVID-19 because they cannot socially distance as needed, such as travel, attending large social or mass gatherings, or being in crowded indoor settings.
                    <li>People who have been asked or referred to get testing by their healthcare provider, localexternal icon or state ​health department.</li Not everyone needs to be tested. If you do get tested, you should self-quarantine/isolate at home
                            pending test results and follow the advice of your health care provider or a public health professional. </li>

                    <p>COVID-19 is a respiratory condition caused by a coronavirus. Some people are infected but don’t notice any symptoms. Most people will have mild symptoms and get better on their own. But about 1 in 6 will have severe problems, such
                        as trouble breathing. The odds of more serious symptoms are higher if you’re older or have another health condition like diabetes or heart disease. Here’s what to look for if you think you might have COVID-19.

                    </p>
                    <h5>Face</h6> Is one side of the person’s face numb or drooping? Is their smile lopsided?
                        <h5>Arms.</h6> Is one arm weak or numb? If they try to raise both arms, does one arm sag?
                            <h5>Speech</h6>. Can they speak clearly? Ask them to repeat a sentence.
                                <h5>Time.</h6> Every minute counts when someone shows signs of a stroke. Call 911 right away.

            <p> People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fever or chills</li>
                <li>Cough</li>

                    <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads easily among people, and more continues to be discovered over time about how it spreads. Data has shown that it spreads mainly from person to person among those in close contact (within about
                        6 feet, or 2 meters). The virus spreads by respiratory droplets released when someone with the virus coughs, sneezes, breathes,sings or talks. These droplets can be inhaled or land in the mouth, nose or eyes of a person nearby.</p>
                    In some situations, the COVID-19 virus can spread by a person being exposed to small droplets or aerosols that stay in the air for several minutes or hours — called airborne transmission. It's not yet known how common it is for the virus to spread this
                    way.

            <br>
            <img src="treat.jpg" width="600px">
            <br><br>
            <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are a fever, coughing, and breathing problems. Unless you have severe symptoms, you can most likely treat them at home, the way you would for a cold or the flu. Most people recover from COVID-19 without
                the need for hospital care. Call your doctor to ask about whether you should stay home or get medical care in person. Scientists are trying to make new medicines and test some existing drugs to see whether they can treat COVID-19. In the
                meantime, there are a number of things that can relieve symptoms, both at home and at the hospital.</p>

            <p>The most important thing to do is to avoid infecting other people, especially those who are over 65 or who have other health problems.</p>

            <p>That Means:</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Try to stay in one place in your home. Use a separate bedroom and bathroom if you can.</li>

                <li>Tell others you're sick so they keep their distance.</li>
                <li>Cover your coughs and sneezes with a tissue or your elbow.</li>
                <li>Wear a mask over your nose and mouth if you can.</li>
                <li>Wash regularly, especially your hands.</li>
                <li>Don't share dishes, cups, eating utensils, towels, or bedding with anyone else.</li>
                <li>Clean and disinfect common surfaces like doorknobs, counters, and tabletops.li>
            </ul>
            <p>You may get extra oxygen through two small tubes that go just inside your nostrils. In very serious cases, doctors will connect you to a machine that can breathe for you, called a ventilator.</p>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-7">
                    <h2>Coronavirus Treatment in a Hospital</h2>
                    <p>You don't need to go to the hospital or ER if you have basic COVID-19 symptoms, like a mild fever or cough. If you do, many hospitals will send you home.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Check the levels of oxygen in your blood with a clip-on finger monitor</li>
                        <li>Listen to your <a>lungs</a></li>
                        <li>Give you a COVID-19 test. This involves putting a 6-inch cotton swab up both sides of your nose for about 15 seconds.</li>
                        <li>Give you a chest X-ray or CT scan</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3> What to expect</h3>

                    Symptoms begin 2 to 14 days after you come into contact with the virus. Early studies show that many people who have mild infections recover within 2 weeks. More severe cases tend to last 3 to 6 weeks.

            <br>
            <p>It might seem like the glorious era of remote work is upon us, driven by a pandemic push. Zoom! Slack! Who needs the office? The promise of uncompromised productivity paired with freedom is alluring. I’m a behavioral scientist, though, so
                color me skeptical. While software can ostensibly replicate the features of an office, there are some underlying behavioral tricks that physical offices have mastered. We may not want to discard them so quickly.</p>
            <h1>It’s called… work.</h1>
            Work works. It gets us to do small things (show up on time, respond to boring emails) and big things (launch new products that never existed before!). It helps us create habits and track progress. It allows us to learn hard things quickly.

                    A COVID‑19 vaccine is a vaccine intended to provide acquired immunity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2), the virus causing Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19). Prior to the COVID‑19 pandemic, work to develop a vaccine
                    against coronavirus diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) established knowledge about the structure and function of coronaviruses; this knowledge enabled accelerated development
                    of various vaccine technologies during early 2020. Vaccines in Phase 3 Clinical Trials As of December 28, 2020, large-scale (Phase 3) clinical trials are in progress or being planned for three COVID-19 vaccines in the United States:
                    AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine Janssen’s COVID-19 vaccine Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccine​

            <h1>What are protein subunit vaccines and how could they be used against COVID-19?</h1>
            All vaccines work by exposing the body to molecules from the target pathogen to trigger an immune response – but the method of exposure varies. Here’s how subunit vaccines work. Other subunit vaccines are already in widespread use. Examples include the
            hepatitis B and acellular pertussis vaccines (protein subunit), the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (polysaccharide), and the MenACWY vaccine, which contains polysaccharides from the surface of four types of the bacteria which causes meningococcal
            disease joined to diphtheria or tetanus toxoid (conjugate subunit).
            <br><br>
            <h5>Although slower to develop, protein-based vaccines are well understood with a strong record of safety and effectiveness</h5>

            There are no protein-based vaccines among the nine candidates in phase 3 clinical trials for Covid-19. The fastest efforts so far rely on inactivated virus, nucleic acids or vector-based strategies.<br>

                    Nucleic acid vaccines use genetic material from a disease-causing virus or bacterium (a pathogen) to stimulate an immune response against it. Depending on the vaccine, the genetic material could be DNA or RNA; in both cases it provides the instructions
                    for making a specific protein from the pathogen, which the immune system will recognise as foreign (an antigen). Once inserted into host cells, this genetic material is read by the cell’s own protein-making machinery and used to manufacture
                    antigens, which then trigger an immune response.

                    Viral vector vaccines use a modified version of a different virus (the vector) to deliver important instructions to our cells. For COVID-19 viral vector vaccines, the vector (not the virus that causes COVID-19, but a different, harmless virus) will enter
                    a cell in our body and then use the cell’s machinery to produce a harmless piece of the virus that causes COVID-19. This piece is known as a spike protein and it is only found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19.

                    can still grow and replicate, but does not cause illness. Inactivated vaccines contain viruses whose genetic material has been destroyed by heat, chemicals or radiation so they cannot infect cells and replicate, but can still trigger
                    an immune response.

            <h1>What are whole virus vaccines and how could they be used against COVID-19?</h1>
            All vaccines work by exposing the body to molecules from the target pathogen to trigger an immune response – but the method of exposure varies. Here’s how subunit vaccines work. Other subunit vaccines are already in widespread use. Examples include the
            hepatitis B and acellular pertussis vaccines (protein subunit), the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (polysaccharide), and the MenACWY vaccine, which contains polysaccharides from the surface of four types of the bacteria which causes meningococcal
            disease joined to diphtheria or tetanus toxoid (conjugate subunit).

            <h5>Although slower to develop, protein-based vaccines are well understood with a strong record of safety and effectiveness</h5>

            There are no protein-based vaccines among the nine candidates in phase 3 clinical trials for Covid-19. The fastest efforts so far rely on inactivated virus, nucleic acids or vector-based strategies.<br>

            <p>In the face of fears surrounding COVID-19, it's entirely practical (and even recommended) to practice emergency preparedness. That doesn't mean you should run to the nearest supermarket and buy up all the cans available—remember that hoarding
                food hurts communities! But think of this time as an exercise in smart and practical shopping. That means investing in versatile foods with a long shelf-life that will also nourish you in the most nutritious way possible during the coronavirus
                quarantine. You don't have to be concerned that grocery stores are going to run out of stock. But the benefit of keeping a stocked pantry is that it will help you limit the number of times you leave the house. Plus, when you have a pantry
                full of healthy food items, it can help you maintain a sense of calm and readiness.</p>

            <p>There is little doubt that the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is affecting every aspect of our lives—from virtual classrooms to telecommuting to early restaurant closing times to outright quarantines. Observing public health measures and
                reducing exposure to the virus are required to slow the spread of this disease. No one knows how long these virus safety measures will need to stay in place, but it presents a perfect time to protect and improve your health while practicing
                social distancing. Healthy eating is especially important for keeping your immune system in top condition. Here are some steps you can take to eat healthy in the times of COVID.</p>
